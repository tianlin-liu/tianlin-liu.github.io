Hello and welcome to my website!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in economics at [Texas A&M University](https://liberalarts.tamu.edu/economics/).  
My research lies at the intersection of microeconomic theory and behavioral economics. I am particularly interested in using insights from experiments and administrative data to inform the implementation of concepts from mechanism design.

I will be available on the 2024 job market.

`Research Interests`  
Experimental Economics, Microeconomic Theory, Political Economy
